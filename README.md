# PRE DOC

This is an overview on data (spatial) visulization example in support of my application as a pre-doctoral Research Assistant. The repository is structured in the following way: 

1. coding_sample
This file consists of all the relevant code necessary to replicate the plots within this repository. In order to reproduce the results the working directory on your machiene should be changed to this repository. Please note that some of the raw R plots are post-processed using affinity designer. Therefore the produced output is not necessarly final. 

2. plots
This folder consits of all the intermediate plots used in producing the final results. That is pre-processed shaded reliefs generated in QGis, but also the plots produced by R which are then post-processed. 

3. RAW
This folder consits of all the datasets which are used in order to produce the results.
